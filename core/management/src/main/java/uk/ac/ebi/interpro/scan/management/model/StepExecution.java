/**
 * Abstract class for executing a StepInstance.
 * <p/>
 * This class has two functions - firstly to control StepExecution
 * and allow the Master to determine if a StepInstance is currently
 * running, has failed or has been completed.
 * <p/>
 * Secondly it stores auditing information about the execution in the
 * database, allowing (for example) a user to determine the cost
 * of specific pieces of processing.
 * <p/>
 * All things being equals, this class should be FINAL, but can't
 * be because of JPA.  (So don't subclass!)
